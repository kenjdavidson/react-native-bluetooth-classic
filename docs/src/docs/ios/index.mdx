## Installation

As previously described the `react-native-bluetooth-classic` is installed through NPM:

```shell
$ npm install react-native-bluetooth-classic --save
```

Once installed [autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md) will take over and all that is required is starting the application as normal.  Be sure to check out the previous link if you need to customize or disable the autolinking of this (or any) module.

## MFi Protocols

Remember to make sure you have your protocol strings provided within your application `plist` file - this is a requirement of the External Accessory framework.  This is the top cause of:

> `Unhandled JS Exception: TypeError: Cannot read property 'xxx' of undefined`

while attempting to use the library.  An example of what this looks like in your own `plist` file is:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>UISupportedExternalAccessoryProtocols</key>
  <array>
    <string>com.apple.m1</string>
  </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

There are also a number of other IOS security related items that are required:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Access bluetooth device over serial connection to document connection features</string>

```


> In iOS17 a seemingly silent change has occurred where `utf` encoded strings with newline characters are encoded in an unexpected way. This means that the default delimiter of a new line character does not get picked up in the `read` function and so no message is returned. To fix this the default encoding has been changed to  `nonLossyASCII`. [Encoding Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string/encoding/nonlossyascii).

## F.A.Q

#### Why isn't my protocol working?

Remember these are MFi protocols, they are not communication protocols.  This is the primary reason or issue that gets asked with regards to IOS, the example above `com.apple.m1` is **not a real protocol** and will not provide you with access to devices.

#### Where do I get MFi protocols?

You either need to find the protocols listed on the companies website (Zebra for example has some posted) but in most cases these are kept super secret; like Fight Club secret!

Getting devices MFi compliant costs companies a boat load of money, so they don't generally give these out for free.  You'll need to work with a vendor constantly (as you'll find there are some super annoying things to do for releasing).

#### I Can See my Device in Bluetooth Screen

The IOS Bluetooth screen will always display your devices.  The MFi layer that provides the functionality `ExternalAccessory` library is where the issue is.  You need to provide a valid set of protocol strings that match your devices MFi compliance in order to get access to them in your app.

#### How to I change Encoding?

The default connection uses [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfstringbuiltinencodings](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfstringbuiltinencodings) values when setting `DEVICE_ENCODING` during connection.
