## Installation

As previously described the `react-native-bluetooth-classic` is installed through NPM:

```shell
$ npm install react-native-bluetooth-classic --save
```

Once installed [auto linking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md) will take over and all that is required is starting the application as normal.  Be sure to check out the previous link if you need to customize or disable the autolinking of this (or any) module.

Auto linking performs the task of dynamically adding the default package:

`new RNBluetoothClassicPackage()`

to your application packages.

## API Overview

The primary classes that you may need to work with are:

### RNBluetoothClassicPackage

[RNBluetoothClassicPackage](/android/rn-bluetooth-classic-package/) is responsible for providing the `DeviceConnection` configuration to the `RNBluetoothClassicModule`.  You're able to provide your own implementation to React Native `MainApplication` or `react-native.config.js` file, more information can be found in the [guides](/guides/customize-connection/).

#### RNBluetoothClassicPackage.Builder

[RNBluetoothClassicPackage.Builder](/android/rn-bluetooth-classic-package/#rnbluetoothclassicpackagebuilder) provides a fluent method for creating the `RNBluetoothClassicPackage`.  The builder is used to provide customized `ConnectionAcceptor`(s), `ConnectionConnector`(s) and `DeviceConnection`(s) to the [RNBluetoothClassicModule](/android/rn-bluetooth-classic-module/)

### RNBluetoothClassicModule

[RNBluetoothClassicModule](/android/rn-bluetooth-classic-module/) manages all communication between Android and React Native.

### ConnectionAcceptor

[ConnectionAcceptor](/android/connection-acceptor/) provides a standard interface for accepting connections with the `BluetoothAdapter`.  A single implementation [RfcommAcceptorThreadImpl](/android/connection-acceptor/#rfcommconnectionacceptorthreadimpl) is provided by the default package.

### ConnectionConnector

[ConnectionConnector](/android/connection-connector/) provides a standard interface for performing connection to individual devices.  A single implementation [RfcommConnectorThreadImpl](/android/conncetion-connector/#rfcommconnectorthreadimpl) is provided by the default package.

### DeviceConnection

[DeviceConnection](/android/device-connection/) is responsible for all the communication between Android and the device.  This is where most of the customization will be made:

- Providing different event handling, middleware
- Handling different message types and formats
- Etc.

There are two current implementations available:

- [DelimitedStringDeviceConnectionImpl](/android/device-connection/#delimitedstringdeviceconnectionimpl)
- [HexDeviceConnectionImpl](/android/device-connection/#hexdeviceconnectionimpl)

## Customization

Customization of the native module is done through implementation of your own `RNBluetoothClassicPackage`.  For more information take a look at the [package documentation](/android/rn-bluetooth-classic-package) or some of the guides available.

## Android Permissions

Android permissions need to be requested within your application (much like Camera).  To do this check out the example application code, and look for the [PermissionsAndroid](https://reactnative.dev/docs/permissionsandroid) within `react-native`:

```
import { PermissionsAndroid } from 'react-native';

/**
 * See https://reactnative.dev/docs/permissionsandroid for more information
 * on why this is required (dangerous permissions).
 */
const requestAccessFineLocationPermission = async () => {
  const granted = await PermissionsAndroid.request(
    PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION,
    {
      title: 'Access fine location required for discovery',
      message:
        'In order to perform discovery, you must enable/allow ' +
        'fine location access.',
      buttonNeutral: 'Ask Me Later',
      buttonNegative: 'Cancel',
      buttonPositive: 'OK',
    }
  );
  return granted === PermissionsAndroid.RESULTS.GRANTED;
};
```
