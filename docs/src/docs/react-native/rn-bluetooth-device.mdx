title: Bluetooth Device
description: Connect and communicate with device(s)
---

The `BluetoothDevice` is where the magic of communicating with your actual devices takes place. You're always going to be requesting your `BluetoothDevice` from one of the `RNBluetoothClassic` functions. Once you've got that device (or a saved address which which you can simulate an address) you're good to go.

```javascript
import RNBluetoothClassic, {
  BluetoothEventType,
  BluetoothDevice,
} from "react-native-bluetooth-classic";
```

## Common API

The following are available on both Android and IOS.

### isConnected

`isConnected(): Promise<boolean>`

Whether or not the current device is connected - note that like everywhere else **connected** means that there is an active `BluetoothSocket` and not just paired.

###### Requests

- Look into adding an `isPaired()` request that does the same

### connect

`connect(options: Map<string,object>): Promise<boolean>`

Connect to the device. This will attempt to open a `BluetoothSocket` (or some other connection type based on configuration) using the options provided.

```javascript
async connect() {
  try {
    let connection = await this.props.device.isConnected();
    if (!connection) {
      connection = await this.props.device.connect(this.state.connectionOptions);
    }

    this.setState({connection});
    this.initializeRead();
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error accordingly
  }
}
```

###### Parameters

`options: map<string,object>` provides a definition of connection properties used at different levels of the library. The following describe the default implementations:

**RNBluetoothClassicModule**

`CONNECTOR_TYPE` - specify the connector; defaults to `rfcomm`

`CONNECTION_TYPE` - specify the connection; defaults to `delimited`

**RfcommConnectorThreadImpl**

`SECURE_SOCKET` - whether to initiate connection with secure or insecure socket; defaults to `true`.

**DelimitedStringDeviceConnectionImpl**

`DELIMITER` - delimiter used to split messages; defaults to `\n`. Providing no delimiter will cause `read` and `onReceivedData` to stream all available information with no segmentation.

`DEVICE_CHARSET` - the character set for encoding String data; defaults to `ascii`. Android uses `Charset` values, while IOS uses integer values for determining character sets. See the specific implementation for details.

`READ_SIZE` - provides the ability to increase the amount of data read per cycle; defaults to `1024`. A number of forks have determined that increasing this value improves performance.

`READ_TIMEOUT` - adds an extra timeout to the read cycle; defaults to `0`. This is a hold over from the original implementation with a value of `300`, it was removed as the read method is already blocking and had a large number of requests/forks.

```javascript
const connected = await connect({
  CONNECTOR_TYPE: "rfcomm",
  DELIMITER: "\n",
  DEVICE_CHARSET: Platform.OS === "ios" ? 1536 : "utf-8",
});
```

### disconnect

`disconnect(): Promise<boolean>`

Attempts to disconnect from the device.

```javascript
async disconnect() {
  try {
    const disconnected = await this.props.device.disconnect();
    this.setState({connection: !disconnected});
  } catch(error) {
    // Handle error accordingly
  }
}
```

### available

`available(): Promise<number>`

Requests how much data is available for read. Resolves with a number based on the connection type, for example the `DelimitedConnection*Impl`(Java) connections return the number of delimited messages **not the number of bytes** as you might expect.

```javascript
try {
  const messages = await this.props.device.available();
  if (messages.length > 0) {
    performRead();
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Handle accordingly
}
```

### clear

`clear(): Promise<boolean>`

Clear all the messages currently in the buffer. This is really only used for manual reads, as listening to received data would automatically clear.

### read

`read(): Promise<BluetoothMessage>`

Reads from the device buffer and returns a `BluetoothMessage` containing information regarding the data. The amount and type of data is dependant on the native `DeviceConnection`. The default `DelimitedConnection*Impl` connections return plain strings, encoded/decoded using the requested `Charset`

```javascript
try {
  const message = await this.props.device.read();
  this.setState({ data: message.data });
} catch (error) {
  // Handle error accordingly
}
```

###### Errors

- Any errors occur during reading

### write

`write(data: string|Buffer, encoding?: string): Promise<boolean>`

Attempts to write to the device. Like the `read` function, this is completely dependant on the `DeviceConnection` on how this data is written.

###### Parameters

`data: string|buffer` must be in the format that your `DeviceConnection` is expecting. Upon request, the content will be sent to the native side as after being `Base64` encoded. This means that if you wish to send `byte[]` or `hex` you need to ensure the data is already encoded as such.
`encoding?: "utf-8" | "ascii" | "utf8" | "utf16le" | "ucs2" | "ucs-2" | "base64" | "latin1" | "binary" | "hex" | undefined` used to specify encoding of non Buffer data prior to sending to native

The default remains to encode `strings` as `utf-8` when not specified.

###### Errors

- If the `Socket` is closed
- Any other errors occur while writing

### onDataReceived

`onDataReceived( listener: BluetoothEventListener<BluetoothDeviceReadEvent> ): BluetoothEventSubscription`

Provide a listener for incoming data. Without adding a listener data will be appended to the buffer and made available for:

- `read()`
- the next `onReceivedData()`

> This is controlled by an augmented `RCTDeviceEmitter` and a ported Android version that is based specifically on the `BluetoothEventType` instead of just a rough estimate.

###### Parameters

`listener: BluetoothEventListener<BluetoothDeviceReadEvent>` called when new `BluetoothReadEvent` is fired.

###### Returns

`BluetoothEventSubscription` which must be used to `remove()` the listener.

```javascript
initializeRead() {
  this.readSubscription = this.props.device.onDataReceived((data) => this.onReceivedData(data));
}

async onReceivedData(event: BluetoothReadEvent) {
    this.addData({
      ...event,
      timestamp: new Date(),  // Add the current date
      type: 'receive'         // Add a type for UI
    });
  }
```
