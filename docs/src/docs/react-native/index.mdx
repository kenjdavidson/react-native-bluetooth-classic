title: Getting Started
description: Start using RNBluetoothClassic in your Application
---

Get started by installing the library into your application:

```shell
npm install --save react-native-bluetooth-classic
```

or from a specific branch:

```shell
npm install --save kenjdavidson/react-native-bluetooth-classic#release/1.0.x
```

Once installed, you can open up your environment(s) and rebuild your application. Your native builds should be autolinked (I hope) so you'll just need to pull in the native module and get going with the [api](/react-native/rn-bluetooth-classic/).

```javascript
import RNBluetoothClassic, {
  BluetoothDevice
} from 'react-native-bluetooth-classic;
```
