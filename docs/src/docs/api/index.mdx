import { IoLogoAndroid } from 'react-icons/io';
import { IoLogoApple } from 'react-icons/io';

Not all functionality is available across both Android and IOS (for Apple MFi related annoying details); for that reason all calls will respond with a `Promise` which will throw an implementation error if attempting to call on IOS (which is completely different from previous versions where IOS would just reject the Promise).  You'll probably want to either:

- Wrap your functionality in `Platform.IOS`
- Duplicate your code with `Component.[android|ios].js`
- or handle the the `Error` appropriately

## RN Bluetooth Classic

`RNBluetoothClassic` is the primary point of access for all Adapter/External Accessory related calls.

```javascript
import RNBluetoothClassic from 'react-native-bluetooth-classic';
```

Provides access to the following:

> IMPORTANT: The term **connection** refers to an active `socket`!  Most of the questions received are related to the fact that the terms **connected**
> and **connection** are being used when **bonded** is meant.

## Bluetooth Device

`BluetoothDevice`(s) are available from a number of `RNBluetoothClassic` functions. These are the functions available while working with `BluetoothDevice`(s):

| API                | Description                                           | Platforms                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| [isConnected]()    | Determine whether the device has an active connection | <IoLogoAndroid/> <IoLogoApple/> |
| [connect]()        | Attempt connection to the device                      | <IoLogoAndroid/> <IoLogoApple/> |
| [disconnect]()     | Attempt to disconnect from the device                 | <IoLogoAndroid/> <IoLogoApple/> |
| [available]()      | Whether and how much data is available for read       | <IoLogoAndroid/> <IoLogoApple/> |
| [clear]()          | Clear the current read buffer                         | <IoLogoAndroid/> <IoLogoApple/> |
| [read]()           | Read data from the device (if available)              | <IoLogoAndroid/> <IoLogoApple/> |
| [write]()          | Write to the device                                   | <IoLogoAndroid/> <IoLogoApple/> |
| [onDataReceived]() | Add a listener to handle read events                  | <IoLogoAndroid/> <IoLogoApple/> |

> **onDataReceived** and **read** shouldn't really be used at the same time as you could end up with half filled data or random errors. I suggest sticking to one method `setInterval` or `onRead` in order to continuously get data

> A number of the previous functions are also available directly from `RNBluetoothClassic`. But in most cases it's wise to use the `BluetoothDevice` returned from one of the prior functions in order to manage directly
